Some info for a good transition from Q3Radiant 202 to GtkRadiant:

- shortcut keys are now in shortcuts.ini
    the syntax has changed a bit, no spaces between the '='
    see shortcuts.sample
- no longer using the registry, settings are stored in radiant.ini and savedinfo.bin
    in Radiant directory
- project settings templates:
    the project settings file format has changed a bit.
    it has version information now, and the setups come with a new quakev2.qe4 file
    the project files are true templates, Radiant will read them and then store actual
    project settings it uses in baseq3/scripts/user0.qe4 user1.qe4 etc.
- new compilation monitoring
    GtkRadiant comes with a modified version of q3map that reports to GtkRadiant through
      the network. You get the output of q3map in the console window. And the compiling
      errors can be processed (currently it detects leaks)
- sleep mode:
    before running Quake 3 Arena to playtest your maps, you can put Radiant to sleep:
    manually with File > Sleep command
    automatic if you compile and set "Activate sleep mode when running the engine"

known issues:
- View n2&3 crashes on sleep mode
