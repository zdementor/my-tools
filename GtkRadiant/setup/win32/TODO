TODO list for 1.2 setup:

- do we need some DO_* variables for the plugins too..  
- does the nightly do some safe checks while installing?
  (i.e. query the GUID of the existing full installation we expect to find)

short explanation / design doc:

------------

Any setup is made from a core and some game packs
In the template -> buildable setup process, we give a few parameters to
customize things:

- Put only the binaries or put everything
- put / don't put the editor core
- put / don't put any game pack

To do this, we mostly rely on a search replace in the template code:

DO_* are variables telling wether are not a given component is INCLUDED into
the setup. We have currently:

DO_CORE: editor core content
  (ex: the central editor binary)
DO_CORE_FULL: include the full setup content related to the code
  (ex: the GtkRadiant manual)
DO_GAME_Q3: include binaries for Q3
DO_GAME_FULL_Q3: media for the Q3 game pack

we search and replace for '<<DO_CORE_BOOL>>' '<<DO_GAME_Q3_BOOL>>' etc.
more such variables will be .. DO_GAME_WOLF_BOOL, DO_GAME_Q1_BOOL etc.
the *_BOOL are meant to be replaced by '1' or '0'
we use equivalents *_BOOL_YESNO that are replaced by 'Yes' and 'No'
(those are used for 'include in build setting')

-------------

Installation paths:
the variables DIR_* are holding the install paths for core or game packs
DIR_CORE is the install path for the core
DIR_GAME_Q3 is the Q3 directory
DIR_GAMETOOLS_Q3 is the subdirectory path choosen below Q3 dir to install
  game specific stuff
  
When the setup executes, it must rely on the stuff included in the setup to
prompt the user with the right questions (where do I install the editor,
where do I install the Q3 game pack?). This should be tempered by prior
selection of what and whatnot to install if necessary. There should always
be a 'Default' path that allows installing quickly without answering any
difficult questions.

-------------

Nightly builds:

this was added afterwards. nightlies are intended to be an upgrade 
over an existing installation it only holds binaries

also adds some specific component and file groups for the media stuff 
that may have changed since the full setup

how does it work?
a matter of 'include in build' configuration again
if nightly is on, the *_FULL_* variables will be disabled
and the *_NIGHTLY_* ones will be enabled
Component Definitions/Default.cdf is the critical file in this operation
added the following:
DO_CORE_BOOL_FULL_YESNO
DO_GAME_Q3_BOOL_FULL_YESNO
DO_GAME_WOLF_BOOL_FULL_YESNO
those three are to disable the media we only put in full setup
DO_NIGHLY_BOOL_YESNO
this is for the specific additions of the nightly setup
